"The class of Deep Neural Networks that are most powerful in image processing tasks are
called Convolutional Neural Networks. Convolutional Neural Networks consist of layers of
small computational units that process visual information hierarchically in a feed-forward manner.Each layer of units can be understood as a collection of image filters, each of which
extracts a certain feature from the input image. Thus, the output of a given layer consists of
so-called feature maps: differently filtered versions of the input image."

To obtain a representation of the style of an input image, we use a feature space originally
designed to capture texture information.
